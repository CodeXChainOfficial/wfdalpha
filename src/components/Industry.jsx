The substantial growth also brought a lot of innovation expected to continually drive the growth in the coming years. One of the key drivers for success of a company or game is the dialogue between game developers and the players. With WeFund, the players can be investors in the projects game developers want to build. With WeFund\'s system and profit-sharing incentive, the players will determine the success of projects and any campaigns that do not reach its fundraising goal will have the capital returned to the investors.',

      'Content creators are dependent on the platforms hosting them. For example, in 2021 OnlyFans creators specializing in adult content were (briefly) banned from the platform. According to Time.com, WeFund made the decision to ban adult content because banks and other financial institutions were not willing to invest in OnlyFans when they were hosting adult content creators. With WeFunds decentralization, there is a solution for content creators to express and share their content without the uncertainty of their content being restricted. According to insider.com, there were 31 Netflix series that were canceled in 2021 with budget being one of the main reasons. By using WeFund, film makers, producers, and fans can provide the freedom to crowdfund the necessary capital for their projects. With this opportunity, this removes the barrier of budget as the fans are the main drivers of a project\'s success.',

FC Barcelona has 227.3 million fans globally and the fans are willing to spend a lot of money on their team and its memorabilia. A fundraising campaign on WeFund could repurpose the souvignier spending of its fans and instead generate the funds needed to fulfill the salary requirements of Lionel Messi. In this case, a small donation from a small percentage of the club\'s fanbase could have fulfilled the funding requirements.',

      'Real estate is one of the most stable and low risk long-term investments, however, there are many barriers that make real estate investing unattainable. With WeFund these barriers will no longer be a problem as each person invests as much as they want and is able to decide the risk they are comfortable with. WeFund aims to drastically improve the selection and quality of real estate projects by the direct participation in the investment by all stakeholders. The projects will reach the fundraising goals when a large number of backers are directly invested and involved. One of the components  restricting the growth of real estate, and many other industries, are the inability to reach a larger community of investors that know consumer demands. WeFund brings together the strength of many, not a few, to benefit financially and show support for projects that meet the consumer\'s demands.',
