              Anchor Protocol is Angel Protocol provides charities across the world, large and small and with a huge variety of aims, with their own free endowments.
               This enables them to connect to more donors, provides them with a more reliable income stream and allows them to spend less time on fundraising and more time to focus on what they do best. 
               <br/><br/> 
               Donations are directed to a charityâ€™s Angel Protocol account and automatically invested in low-risk, high-yielding products made possible by blockchain technologies (also known as Decentralized Finance or DeFi). 
               Every week, a portion of the interest from those DeFi products is sent to the charity and the remainder is automatically reinvested, compounding in perpetuity
